Bio-Cryptography

As devices become integrated into our biology, we need new ways to secure these systems

A fundamental problem of cryptography is that authentication of genuine users rely on knowledge of hidden tokens. Biometrics uses biological features that are unique for each person. This type of authentication is more powerful and secure than any system we currently have in place. However, these biometric systems have few security protocols. The goal of this project is to develop new ways to secure biological systems using the core function of conventional cryptographic methods.
